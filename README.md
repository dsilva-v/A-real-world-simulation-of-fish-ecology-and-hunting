It is a predator prey kind of simulation model  with fishes as preys , hunters as predators and  a food source  that reproduces continuously.
What’s New and Different from the same old Model?
  Major differences are :
Hunters can only hunt when it is a Fishing Season and Hunting is allowed.
If pollution is on , all fishes will be dead and hunters go to the reserves to get re-energized and the system halts.
Also, if it is a fishing season and if any catastrophes occur suddenly, i.e. bad weather is on, boats are not allowed to  carryout fishing.
Also, if the hunting is off even if it is fishing season and no catastrophes, it’s energy reduces and boats can’t fish.
System also halts if the count of fishes drops to 0.
Fishes can escape from the hunters.
